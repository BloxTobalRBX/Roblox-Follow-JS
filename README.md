# How i execute the code?
Well To execute you have to go to the roblox website, open the console by pressing F12 and select console and paste it the code and press enter.

# why are there multiple js files?
Because there are different functions of the code to follow users for example:

# Follow-StartID.js
the code will follow users 1 by 1]

# FollowByList.js
this code will follow the users in the list, you can add more users just by creating another line with the user id.

# Follow-Users.js
This will only follow users using random numbers, if you want to follow new users you can add another 9 in the line 'limitid'.
