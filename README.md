the code is a remix of an old code found.

# How i execute the code?
Well To execute you have to go to the roblox website, open the console by pressing F12 and select console and paste it the code and press enter.

# ⚠️WARNING⚠️
1 ● if you have 429 error means you have ratelimit, you have to wait 1 hour, and you can run the code again.

2 ● the code has some bugs, for example, when an account is banned, it will not continue to follow users on roblox. i recommend that you re-run the code.

3 ● If you get a 403 error, don't worry, the code will continue to follow users in roblox.

# why are there multiple js files?
Because there are different functions of the code to follow users for example:

# Follow-StartID.js
the code will follow users 1 by 1.

# FollowByList.js
this code will follow the users in the list, you can add more users just by creating another line with the user id.

# Follow-Users.js
This will only follow users using random numbers, if you want to follow new users you can add another 9 in the line 'limitid'.
